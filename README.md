# ImageRecMNIST
Self-learned way to teach myself how to make a CNN model for Image Recognition of Fashion MNIST

used the tensorflow keras dataset library for the dataset

The model is a Convolution2D Neural Network that consist:
a 128 Dense Layer
a 10 output Layer

The model is not fine-tuned to enshure the simplicity of the basic idea behind CNN

comments are available to describe the code in .ipynb file
